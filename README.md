# RISC-V Single-Cycle and Pipelined Processor Design

## Overview
This repository showcases the design and implementation of a 3-stage pipelined processor built on the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).

## Supported Instructions

### Data Processing Instructions
- **R-type**: ADD, SUB, SLL, SLT, SLTU, XOR, SRL, SRA, OR, AND
- **I-type**: ADDI, SLTI, SLTIU, XORI, ORI, ANDI, SLLI, SRLI, SRAI
- **U-type**: LUI, AUIPC

### Memory Access Instructions
- **I-type**: LB, LH, LW, LBU, LHU
- **S-type**: SB, SH, SW

### Flow Control Instructions
- **J-type**: JAL
- **I-type**: JALR
- **B-type**: BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU

### CSR Instructions
- CSRRW, MRET

## Interrupt Management
The processor is designed to handle timer interrupts effectively:
1. **Interrupt Registration**: Timer interrupts are captured in the `mip` register.
2. **Saving PC**: The current Program Counter (PC) is stored in the `mepc` register upon an interrupt.
3. **ISR Execution**: An interrupt service routine (ISR) provided by the user is executed.
4. **Resumption**: After completing the ISR, the `mret` instruction restores the PC from `mepc` and resumes execution.

## Testing the Processor
The processor’s functionality has been validated through:
- **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) program**
- **Factorial calculation program**

Details for the factorial example can be found in `inst.mem`. The GCD example is linked to a specific commit in this repository.

## Compilation and Simulation

### Compilation Instructions
- Use the `compile.bat` script provided in this repository.
- Alternatively, you can compile using the following commands:

#### For specific files:
```
vlog file1.sv file2.sv ...
```

#### For all SystemVerilog files in the directory:
```
vlog *.sv
```

A `work` directory will be generated to store compilation outputs.

### Simulation Steps
Run the following command to simulate the design:
```
vsim -c top_level_module_name -do "run -all"
```
This generates a `.vcd` file containing the simulation results.

### Viewing Simulation Results
To visualize the waveforms, use:
```
gtkwave dumpfile_name.vcd
```
By default, the dump file is named `processor.vcd`. You can analyze the signals and verify processor behavior using the GTKWave tool.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a robust and efficient implementation of a RISC-V-based pipelined processor. The design handles hazards, interrupts, and control flow effectively, making it a great starting point for exploring RISC-V processor architectures.
